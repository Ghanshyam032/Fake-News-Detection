With the proliferation of social media and online platforms, the dissemination of fake news has become a pressing concern, threatening the integrity of information ecosystems and public discourse. In response, this project aims to develop a robust system for detecting fake news through a combination of machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques. By analyzing textual features, user behavior patterns, and contextual information, the proposed system seeks to differentiate between genuine and fabricated news articles with high accuracy. Through the deployment of this detection mechanism, it is hoped that the spread of misinformation can be curtailed, fostering a more informed and resilient society.

Result

After implementing the methodology outlined for fake news detection using NLP in R, we achieved promising results in distinguishing between genuine and fake news articles. Our model demonstrated strong performance on the test dataset, effectively identifying deceptive or misleading information while minimizing false positives and false negatives.

Furthermore, we conducted extensive experiments to compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms and feature extraction techniques. Our findings highlighted the efficacy of various approaches for fake news detection tasks. Additionally, we conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the model's robustness to variations in the dataset and parameter settings, ensuring reliable performance across diverse scenarios.
