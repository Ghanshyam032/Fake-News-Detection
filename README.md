With the proliferation of social media and online platforms, the dissemination of fake news has become a pressing concern, threatening the integrity of information ecosystems and public discourse. In response, this project aims to develop a robust system for detecting fake news through a combination of machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques. By analyzing textual features, user behavior patterns, and contextual information, the proposed system seeks to differentiate between genuine and fabricated news articles with high accuracy. Through the deployment of this detection mechanism, it is hoped that the spread of misinformation can be curtailed, fostering a more informed and resilient society.
